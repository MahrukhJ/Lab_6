#Comparing model_logit2 which engaged dat_use1 (a subset of people in the Northeast region) and model_logit4 which utilized dat_use2 
#(people who have public health insurance and reside in the West), one of the main differences that I noted was the difference in the quantity 
#of significant values. The dependent and the independent variables were identical for both models (the independent variable being 'vaxx' and the
#dependent variable being EEDUC, MS, RRACE, RHISPANIC and GENID_DESCRIBE). Given this, in model_logit2, EEDUCsome hs, EEDUCHS diploma and RHISPANICHispanic 
#are categorized as being significant at the 0.05 level, EEDUCsome coll and EEDUCassoc deg are significant at 0.01, EEDUCbach deg, EEDUCadv deg, RRACEBlack 
#RRACEAsian and RRACEOther are significant at 0.001. In contrast, for model_logit4, EEDUCbach deg is significant at 0.01 and EEDUCadv deg, RRACEAsian and RRACEOther
#are significant at 0.001. To analyze, in model_logit2, someone with a bachelors degree and someone with an advanced degree are more likely to be vaccinated than someone
#without a bachelors degree or without an advanced degree since the estimate for EEDUCbach deg is 1.91062 and the estimate for EEDUCadv deg is 2.38182. In contrast, RACEOther 
#has an estimate value of -0.85249 which indicates that people in this category are very likely to not get vaccinated. 

I attempted to predict values from model_logit2 however, an error was found where variable lengths differed for 'RHISPANIC' which is why the following model omits RHISPANIC. 

model_logit2_again <- glm(vaxx ~ EEDUC + MS + RRACE + GENID_DESCRIBE,
                          family = binomial, data = dat_use1)
summary(model_logit2_again)

I will predict the probability of a White woman who is married and has a bachelors degree with the folowing code. 
to_be_predicted_1 <- data.frame(EEDUC = "bach deg", MS = "married", RRACE = "White", GENID_DESCRIBE = "female", data = dat_use1)
to_be_predicted_1$yhat <- predict(model_logit2_again, to_be_predicted_1, type = "response")
summary(to_be_predicted_1$yhat)
'Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
0.9547  0.9547  0.9547  0.9547  0.9547  0.9547'

To analyze the results, the probability of a white, married woman who has a bachelors degree in the subset of people in the Northeast is 95.47. 
A very high probability which honestly, I was not expecting! I am interested in observing the difference between the code output if EEDUC was equal to "adv deg" instead of "bach deg".

to_be_predicted1 <- data.frame(EEDUC = "adv deg", MS = "married", RRACE = "White", GENID_DESCRIBE = "female", data = dat_use1)
to_be_predicted1$yhat <- predict(model_logit2_again, to_be_predicted1, type = "response")
summary(to_be_predicted1$yhat)

'Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
0.9712  0.9712  0.9712  0.9712  0.9712  0.9712'
The probability increases to 97.12! 
  More specifically, a white, married woman who lives in the Northeast region and has obtained an adanced degree has a predicted probability of 97.12 percent for being vaccinated. 

Attempting to predict the probability of a divorced Black male with a HS diploma in a subset of people residing in the West who have public health insurance.
model_logit4 <- glm(vaxx ~ EEDUC + MS + RRACE + RHISPANIC + GENID_DESCRIBE,
                    family = binomial, data = dat_use2)
to_be_predicted3 <- data.frame(EEDUC = "HS diploma", MS = "divorced", RRACE = "Black", GENID_DESCRIBE = "male", data = dat_use2)
to_be_predicted3$yhat <- predict(model_logit2_again, to_be_predicted3, type = "response")

0.7942  0.7942  0.7942  0.7942  0.7942  0.7942' 

The probability of a divorced Black male with a HS diploma in a subset of people residing in the West and who have public health insurance getting vaccinated is 79.42. 
A prediction probability significantly less than the predictions generated from to_be_predicted_1 and to_be_predicted1. 

#Moving on to probit models!
A probit regression is used to model binary outcome variables where the inverse standard normal distribution of the probability is modeled as a linear combination of the predictors.
The code below estimates a probit regression model using the generalized linear model(glm) function. The dependent and independent variables are almost identical to model_logit2_again,
the difference being the addition of INCOME as an independent variable in model_probit_1. 

model_probit_1 <- glm(vaxx ~ EEDUC + MS + RRACE + GENID_DESCRIBE + INCOME, family = binomial(link = 'probit'), data = dat_use1)

In this model, the estimate for EEDUCbach deg, EEDUCadv deg, RRACEAsian, RRACEOther, INCOMEHH income $25k - $34.9k, INCOMEHH income $35k - 49.9, INCOMEHH income $50k - 74.9,
INCOMEHH income $75 - 99.9, INCOMEHH income $100k - 149, INCOMEHH income $150 - 199 are all very statistically significant. 
To analyze, the estimate for EEDUCbach deg is 0.93569, which indicates a high liklihood that someone with a bachelors degree will get vaccinated in a subset of people from the Northeast. 
Likewise, the coefficient estimate for INCOMEHH income $25k - $34.9k, INCOMEHH income $35k - 49.9, INCOMEHH income $50k - 74.9, INCOMEHH income $75 - 99.9, INCOMEHH income $100k - 149 and
INCOMEHH income $150 - 199 are all positive and also demosntrate a strong liklihood of receiving vaccinations. RRACEOther, however, has a correlation coefficient of -0.46770 which is also 
statistically significant and indicates a strong liklihood not to get vaccinated. 

We can use the confint function to obtain confidence intervals for the coefficient estimates.

After a series of probability predictions on a divorced Black male with a bachelors degree in a subset of people residing in the Northeast with differing levels of income, I noticed that as the household INCOME
increased, the prediction probability for the individual to get vaccinated also increased. For simplicity sake, all else remaining equal, when INCOME= "HH income less than $25k", the corresponding probability is 92 percent. When
HH income= "$25k - $34.9k", the probability is 92.88, INCOME= "HH income $35k - 49.9", INCOME= "HH income $75 - 99.9", INCOME= "HH income $100k - 149", and when INCOME= "HH income $150 - 199", the probabilities are 
93.55, 95.02, 95.21 and 96.45, respectively. This indicates a correlation between income and probability to get vaccinated, when all of the other variables in the prediction remain identical during comparisons.
